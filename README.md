# cs50mail
This project was made for Harvard's CS50x 2023 Final Project.
It's an emailer, inspired by Gmail, which can send and receive emails to and from other people, but only inside the platform.

This application was made using:
* Flask and Python for managing the backend purposes;
* SQLite for communication with databases;
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for customizing the user experience in the frontend.
